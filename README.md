# Book Recommendation System Project

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a Book Recommendation System project. The goal of this project is to develop a system that recommends books to users based on their preferences, reading history, and other relevant factors. The recommendation system utilizes machine learning algorithms to provide personalized book suggestions to enhance the user's reading experience.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Users can create accounts, log in, and authenticate to the system, allowing the recommendation system to tailor suggestions based on their individual preferences.

- **Book Catalog:** The system maintains a catalog of books with relevant details such as title, author, genre, and synopsis. The catalog is regularly updated to ensure the availability of the latest books.

- **User Preferences:** Users can specify their preferences, including favorite genres, authors, and reading levels. The recommendation system uses this information to generate personalized book suggestions.

- **Rating System:** Users can rate the books they have read, providing feedback that further refines the recommendation algorithm. The system takes into account user ratings to improve the accuracy of suggestions.

- **Recommendation Algorithm:** The core of the system is the recommendation algorithm, which employs machine learning techniques to analyze user behavior, preferences, and ratings. The algorithm continuously learns and adapts to provide increasingly accurate and relevant book recommendations.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Django
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch (depending on the specific algorithm implementation)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation-system.git
   ```

2. Set up the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   cd book-recommendation-system
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure the database:

   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

6. Access the application at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.
